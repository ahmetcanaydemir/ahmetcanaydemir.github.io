For a long time, I have been thinking of renewing my website. I haven’t been blogging for a long time. Renewing my site can also be an important opportunity to start blogging. I’m not sure how much I can achieve, but this year I plan to focus more on blog posts, YouTube videos and open source projects.</p>\n<p>I published the previous version of this website in 2017 and I had almost never changed it. The site was Hugo-based and worked just fine. But I wanted to turn it into a React-based, minimal site that I know better the technology. It was not that difficult to do. <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dan Abramov</a>’s <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">overreacted.io</a> project was based on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby.js</a> and I really liked its minimalism. I made some style changes for myself, added a few pages and the website you have seen now came out.</p>\n<p>On this website, I plan to write blogs in Turkish as well as in English. I know my English is not that good. Thus, I believe my English writing ability can improve. If you see any errors in my sentences, please write to me.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"I Renewed My Personal Website","date":"January 07, 2021","spoiler":"New things in the new year, so I started by renewing my website."},"fields":{"slug":"/renewed-my-personal-website/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/renewed-my-personal-website/","previous":null,"next":null,"translations":["tr"],"translatedLinks":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["336482444"]}
