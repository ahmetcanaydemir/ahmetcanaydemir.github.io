[](/x/)

Finally I did it, I renewed my personal website.

We entered the 2021, every new year people are in search of a change in their lives. For a long time, I have been thinking of renewing my website. I haven't been blogging for a long time. Renewing my site can also be an important opportunity to start blogging. I'm not sure how much I can achieve, but this year I plan to focus more on blog posts, YouTube videos and open source projects.

I published the previous version of this website in 2017 and I had almost never changed it. The site was Hugo-based and worked just fine. But I wanted to turn it into a React-based, minimal site that I know better the technology. It was not that difficult to do. [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)'s [overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) project was based on [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and I really liked its minimalism. I made some style changes for myself, added a few pages and the website you have seen now came out.

On this website, I plan to write blogs in Turkish as well as in English. I know my English is not that good. Thus, I believe my English writing ability can improve. If you see any errors in my sentences, please write to me.
